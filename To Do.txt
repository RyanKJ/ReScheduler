To Do list:


Pythonisize Code:
Polish comments, make pythonic variable naming (use sql/openpyxl namespace?)
    -make attributes and private methods pythonic
    -Make idioms consistent: tk.LEFT only, replace args like 'left'
    -Make sure conditionals are pythonic: 
        -Save method test should have better type checking idioms
    -Get rid of calls to constants like DAY, replace with library calls:
        -MONTHS
        -DAYS
        -Letters for export version: alphabet




To Do General List:
1) Fix issue with different month getting same value as current month
2) Encapsualte tk style in dict?
3) Overhaul save/load/add/remove employee functions for better design: MVC?
4) Make export to excel work well: no need for template
5) Add in warning dialogues
6) Fix autofill
7) Fix updating department list displaying when adding a new department
8) Make schedule.department actually linked to db_department, not just string:
    -Department optionmenu's reflect database departments, not pre-determined
     strings.
9) Clear employee info if employee is removed
    -Also put widgets in disabled state when no employee clicked?
10) Change instantiated calendar upon starting program to be next month 
    of current datetime.datetime.now() month
11) Add optional arg to TimeEntry for setting default values: kwargs?
12) Change application icon
13) Make add_vacation, add_repeat insert new item in sorted order, not at end
14) Add on more validation for save_employee_info
15) Add in scrollbars to schedule editor and listboxes on employee page
16) Get rid of main module, or turn into __init__?




What are the user cases where a dialogue box is useful?
1) The user tries to create a schedule whos end time is less then or equal
    to the start time
3) User wants to save an employee but enter invalid information or 
    the wrong kind of information into the fields: 
    Perhaps a smart program doesn't permit invalid entries?
4) User wants to remove selected employee: Flag a are you sure box
5) User wants to remove a vacation schedule: Simple yes no 
6) User wants to add a vacation schedule but overlaps with assigned work 
    schedules: What should this be?
7) User wants to add a vacation schedule with no employee clicked or 
    an employee yet to be added to DB: flag user with error
8) User wants to add a vacation schedules whos start date is after the 
    end date: flag user with an error
9) User wants to delete a department: yes/no dialogue
