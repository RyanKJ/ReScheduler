To Do list:

1) Make export to excel work well: no need for template
2) Add in warning dialogues
3) Fix updating department list displaying when adding a new department
4) Make schedule.department actually linked to db_department, not just string:
    -Department optionmenu's reflect database departments, not pre-determined
     strings.
5) Add optional arg to TimeEntry for setting default values: kwargs?
6) Change application icon
7) Make add_vacation, add_repeat insert new item in sorted order, not at end
8) Add on more validation for save_employee_info
9) Add in scrollbars to schedule editor and listboxes on employee page
10) Get rid of main module, or turn into __init__?
11) Replace self.parent with __init__ for tk.Frame inheritance for calendar_page
    classes
12) Bug with adding employee with already used ID



What are the user cases where a dialogue box is useful?

1) The user tries to create a schedule whos end time is less then or equal
    to the start time
3) User wants to save an employee but enter invalid information or 
    the wrong kind of information into the fields: 
    Perhaps a smart program doesn't permit invalid entries?
4) User wants to remove selected employee: Flag a are you sure box
5) User wants to remove a vacation schedule: Simple yes no 
6) User wants to add a vacation schedule but overlaps with assigned work 
    schedules: What should this be?
7) User wants to add a vacation schedule with no employee clicked or 
    an employee yet to be added to DB: flag user with error
8) User wants to add a vacation schedules whos start date is after the 
    end date: flag user with an error
9) User wants to delete a department: yes/no dialogue
